This set of code generates shade masks for NEON AOP data by combining sensor and solar view angles with surface models through a ray tracing algorithm.  This code was created as part of an effort to generate foliar trait maps throughout the Department of Energy (DOE) Watershed Function Special Focus Area (WF-FSA). A full description of the effort can be found at:

and use of this code should cite that manuscript.
